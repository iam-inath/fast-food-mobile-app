# Fast-Food Mobile App

## Description

This Fast-Food Mobile App is a web-based application under development designed to provide a seamless and interactive experience for fast-food ordering. The application is built with basic javascript technologies and offers features like adding items to a cart, persisting cart items across page reloads using local storage, and dynamically rendering menu items from a data array.

## Features

-  **Interactive Menu:** The application displays a list of food items fetched from a data array. Each item includes details like name, ingredients, and price.
-  **Add to Cart:** Users can add items to their cart by clicking the '+' button. The cart updates dynamically to reflect the added items.
-  **Persistent Cart:** The application uses local storage to persist cart items. This means that even if the page is reloaded, the cart items remain intact.
-  **Unique ID Generation:** The application uses the `crypto` API to generate unique IDs for cart items.

4. **Ratings and Reviews:** Allow users to rate and review items on the menu.
5. **Personalized Recommendations:** Implement a recommendation system that suggests items to users based on their past orders.
